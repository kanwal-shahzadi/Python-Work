# Python-Work

This repository is used to store and organize all my **Python learning work**. It contains **Jupyter notebooks** for different Python topics, along with **assignment and practice tasks** that I complete while learning.

## Purpose
The main goal of this repository is to:
- Keep Python topic-wise notebooks in one place  
- Track my learning progress  
- Store practice problems and assignments  
- Build a reference for future projects  

## Repository Structure
Each topic is organized in its own notebook, such as:
- Basics of Python  
- Lists, Strings, and Tuples  
- Loops and Conditions  
- Functions  
- And more as I continue learning  

Assignments and practice tasks are also included alongside the relevant topics.

## How to Use
You can open the notebooks using:
- Jupyter Notebook  
- VS Code  
- Google Colab  

Each notebook focuses on a specific Python concept with examples and exercises.

## Status
This repository is actively being updated as I continue to learn and practice Python.
